# Known Issues
  
* It will not scroll the chat list to the newly selected chat
* It **appears** to start a new group chat when selecting one, but if you type a message it will add it to the "existing" chat and the "new" one will disappear.  If you elect **not** to send a message after opening it here, you **can** delete (click on the `x`) the "new" chat without actually deleting the original one.
